/*********************************************************************
IMPORTANT NOTES: This code is currently configured to work with the
schematic found at www.hardlysoftware.com/projects/hidbootldr.com.  
However, this code can be readily adapted for use with the following 
devices:

PIC18F4553/4458/2553/2458
PIC18F4550/4455/2550/2455
PIC18F4450/2450

To do so, replace the linker script with an appropriate version, and
click "Configure --> Select Device" and select the proper
microcontroller.  Also double check to verify that the io_cfg.h and
usbcfg.h are properly configured to match your desired application
platform.

Verify that the coniguration bits are set correctly for the intended
target application, and fix any build errors that result from either
the #error directives, or due to I/O pin count mismatch issues (such
as when using a 28-pin device, but without making sufficient changes
to the io_cfg.h file)

PIC18F14K50 and PIC18F13K50 devices are not yet supported in this
release.  However, some code sections mention these devices in
anticipation for future support.


This project needs to be built with the C18 compiler optimizations
enabled, or the total code size will be too large to fit within the
program memory range 0x000-0xFFF.  The default linker script included
in the project has this range reserved for the use by the bootloader,
but marks the rest of program memory as "PROTECTED".  If you try to
build this project with the compiler optimizations turned off, or
you try to modify some of this code, but add too much code to fit
within the 0x000-0xFFF region, a linker error like that below may occur:

Error - section '.code_main.o' can not fit the section. Section '.code_main.o' length=0x00000082
To fix this error, either optimize the program to fit within 0x000-0xFFF
(such as by turning on compiler optimizations), or modify the linker
and vector remapping (as well as the application projects) to allow this
bootloader to use more program memory.

//	The USB specifications require that USB peripheral devices must never source
//	current onto the Vbus pin.  Additionally, USB peripherals should not source
//	current on D+ or D- when the host/hub is not actively powering the Vbus line.
//	When designing a self powered (as opposed to bus powered) USB peripheral
//	device, the firmware should make sure not to turn on the USB module and D+
//	or D- pull up resistor unless Vbus is actively powered.  Therefore, the
//	firmware needs some means to detect when Vbus is being powered by the host.
//	A 5V tolerant I/O pin can be connected to Vbus (through a resistor), and
// 	can be used to detect when Vbus is high (host actively powering), or low
//	(host is shut down or otherwise not supplying power).  The USB firmware
// 	can then periodically poll this I/O pin to know when it is okay to turn on
//	the USB module/D+/D- pull up resistor.  When designing a purely bus powered
//	peripheral device, it is not possible to source current on D+ or D- when the
//	host is not actively providing power on Vbus. Therefore, implementing this
//	bus sense feature is optional.  This firmware can be made to use this bus
//	sense feature by making sure "USE_USB_BUS_SENSE_IO" has been defined in the
//	usbcfg.h file.    
    #if defined(USE_USB_BUS_SENSE_IO)
    tris_usb_bus_sense = INPUT_PIN; // See io_cfg.h
    #endif

//	If the host PC sends a GetStatus (device) request, the firmware must respond
//	and let the host know if the USB peripheral device is currently bus powered
//	or self powered.  See chapter 9 in the official USB specifications for details
//	regarding this request.  If the peripheral device is capable of being both
//	self and bus powered, it should not return a hard coded value for this request.
//	Instead, firmware should check if it is currently self or bus powered, and
//	respond accordingly.  If the hardware has been configured like demonstrated
//	on the PICDEM FS USB Demo Board, an I/O pin can be polled to determine the
//	currently selected power source.  On the PICDEM FS USB Demo Board, "RA2" 
//	is used for	this purpose.  If using this feature, make sure "USE_SELF_POWER_SENSE_IO"
//	has been defined in usbcfg.h, and that an appropriate I/O pin has been mapped
//	to it in io_cfg.h.    
    #if defined(USE_SELF_POWER_SENSE_IO)
